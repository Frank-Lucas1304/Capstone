# Capstone: Industrial Design/Manufacturing of a Gaming Device for Helping People with ADHD
This was the capstone project of 6 mechanical engineering students at McGill University. For the purpose of the project, 3 students were responsible for designing the and creating games that could potentially benefit individuals with ADHD and integrating it to a prototype. This repository represents cumulative work of the software team throughout the 2023-2024 year.
This includes 4 games that interact with a Novation Launchpad Mini MK3 and an Arduino Nano using Serial Communication.

The following games that were designed:
- Button Blitz --> Reaction time game
- Drawing Mode --> Creative game
- Music Melody --> Memory game
- Piano Mode   --> Creative game
