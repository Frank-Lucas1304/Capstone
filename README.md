# Capstone: Industrial Design/Manufacturing of a Gaming Device for Helping People with ADHD
This was the capstone project of 6 mechanical engineering students at McGill University. For the purpose of the project, 3 students were responsible for designing the and creating games that could potentially benefit individuals with ADHD and integrating it to a prototype. This repository represents cumulative work of the software team throughout the 2023-2024 year.
This includes 4 games that interact with a Novation Launchpad Mini MK3 and an Arduino Nano using Serial Communication.

The following games that were designed:
- Button Blitz --> Reaction time game
- Drawing Mode --> Creative game
- Music Melody --> Memory game
- Piano Mode   --> Creative game

### Button Blitz
Button blitz is a rythm based reaction time game. The target starts from the center of the launchpad and moves towards the outside. The goal is to hit target when it is bright white at the edge of the play area.
There are three song options for the game which increase in speed as the leve is increased.

Song options:
- BGM
- Stayin Alive
- Edance
